## Technical Implementation

### Core Classes

#### DeviceTracker
Main class handling device recognition and learning:

```javascript
const tracker = new DeviceTracker();

// Analyze a power event
const suggestions = tracker.analyzeEvent({
    type: 'peak',           // 'peak' or 'valley'
    phase: 'A',            // 'A', 'B', or 'C'
    powerDelta: 150.5,     // Power change in watts
    timestamp: Date.now(), // Event timestamp
    readings: {...}        // Full sensor readings
});

// Record manual association
tracker.recordDeviceAssociation(event, deviceId, confidence);
```

### Data Structures

#### Event Object
```json
{
    "type": "peak",
    "phase": "A",
    "powerDelta": 150.5,
    "timestamp": 1640995200000,
    "readings": {
        "voltage_a": 235.0,
        "current_a": 1.5,
        "pf_a": 0.7
    }
}
```

#### Device Association
```json
{
    "id": "1640995200001",
    "timestamp": 1640995200000,
    "phase": "A",
    "type": "peak",
    "powerDelta": 150.5,
    "deviceId": "device123",
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "source": "manual",
    "readings": {...}
}
```

### Confidence Scoring

The system uses a multi-factor confidence scoring system:

- **Power Match (0-0.4)**: How well the event power matches device specifications
- **Type Pattern (0-0.3)**: Device type specific characteristics
- **Time Pattern (0-0.15)**: Usage time correlation
- **Historical Match (0-0.5)**: Similar past events
- **Recent Activity (0-0.2)**: Complementary events nearby

**Total Confidence**: Sum of all factors (capped at 1.0)

### Storage & Persistence

All data is stored locally using browser localStorage:

- **Device Associations**: `deviceAssociations` - Manual and automatic associations
- **Learning Data**: `learningData` - Feature vectors for AI training
- **Event History**: `eventHistory` - Recent events for correlation analysis

## Integration Points

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**No Device Suggestions**
- Ensure devices are configured in Environment Setup
- Check that devices are assigned to correct electrical phase
- Verify power event exceeds 8W threshold

**Low Confidence Scores**
- Add more manual associations for training
- Verify device power specifications are accurate
- Check for multiple devices with similar power signatures

**Incorrect Suggestions**
- Manually correct associations to improve learning
- Review device type patterns and power ranges
- Consider time-based usage patterns

### Data Recovery
- Export tracking data regularly for backup
- Import previous tracking data to restore associations
- Manual re-association if data is lost

## Best Practices

### Training Recommendations
1. **Start with Obvious Events**: Associate clear on/off events first
2. **Diverse Training**: Include different times and usage patterns
3. **Regular Review**: Check and correct suggestions weekly
4. **Export Backups**: Save tracking data monthly

### Device Configuration
1. **Accurate Power Ratings**: Use manufacturer specifications
2. **Realistic Estimates**: Measure actual consumption when possible
3. **Distinct Signatures**: Avoid devices with identical power consumption
4. **Phase Verification**: Ensure correct electrical phase assignment

### System Optimization
1. **Threshold Tuning**: Adjust 8W threshold for your environment
2. **Confidence Thresholds**: Set appropriate auto-association levels
3. **Time Windows**: Adjust correlation time windows as needed
4. **Regular Maintenance**: Clean up old associations periodically

## Security & Privacy

### Data Protection
- All processing happens locally in browser
- No data transmitted to external servers
- Export files contain only device associations
- No personal information collected

### Recommendations
- Regular backup of tracking data
- Secure storage of export files
- Consider data privacy when sharing configurations
- Review associations for sensitive device information
